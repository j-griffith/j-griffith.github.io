# j-griffith on github.io

I'm far from being a serious blogger or anything, but I do write some stuff
occasionally (typically about code/OpenStack) and I have slides and such
I like to share.  The thought of just sharing stuff on github.io seemed
pretty appealing, so I'm going to try using it for a while and updating
with stuf that people may or may not find interesting.

I used jekyll and jekyll bootstrap, still lots of missing stuff and holes
to fill, but when I have time maybe I'll poke around and figure stuff out.
